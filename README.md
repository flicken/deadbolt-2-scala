Deadbolt 2 is an authorization library for Play 2, and features APIs for both Java- and Scala-based applications.  It allows you to apply constraints to controller actions, and to customize template rendering based on the current user.

This repository contains the Scala API for Deadbolt.

## 2.5.x Migration guide

* There is no longer a common module shared by the Scala and Java versions of Deadbolt, so there is no more usage of Java types in the API.
* Types previously found in `be.objectify.deadbolt.core.models` are now found in `be.objectify.deadbolt.scala.models`.
* `be.objectify.deadbolt.core.PatternType` is now `be.objectify.deadbolt.scala.models.PatternType`.
* `be.objectify.deadbolt.core.DeadboltAnalyzer` has been re-implemented in Scala as `be.objectify.deadbolt.scala.StaticConstraintAnalyzer`.
* Instead of an implicit `Request`, actions now receive an explicit `AuthenticatedRequest` that contains an `Option[Subject]`.
* The functions of `DeadboltActions` now return a `Future[Result]` in place of an `Action[A]`.
